In the post-pandemic situation, life took an interesting turn as we navigated the new normal. We experienced lockdowns, staying at home, ordering deliveries, and witnessing the world's changes. The vaccine debate was ongoing, and eventually, we decided to get vaccinated in April 2021. Things seemed to evolve differently within our circle. You moved out in 2020, but I stayed, and the reasons for that will be explained in subsequent conversations.

There's a sense that someone wanted me to leave and manipulated information to make it look like I planned to move somewhere. Even when I went to Japan in 2022 to gather more information, there were strange occurrences, with people pretending to be me or already having everything under control. It was frustrating, as it took a toll on our relationship. There's a feeling that you wanted me to break up with you, but I wouldn't, and now the affection seems to be fading. I'm unsure about its meaning.

It appears I'm being used as a beacon, with people looking to me to determine if things are fine or not. The situation is puzzling, and I'm uncertain about the intentions and manipulations happening around us. I'll continue investigating to understand the truth behind these events.
