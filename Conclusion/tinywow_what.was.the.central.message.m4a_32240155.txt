What was the central message? Reiterate the core theme or message you convey
through my story or through our story. Explain how this message evolved and became
clear as the events unfolded. So what was the central message? At his core this
book was a testament to the power of connection, growth, and perseverance. Through
our experiences I hope you've come to realize that relationships are a dynamic
interplay of emotions, challenges, and shared moments that both really shape
what we are. It's pretty windy right now. So yes I agree that the central
measures of this is a basically a testament to the power of connection and
growth. I really believe that you know some people will look at my causes
speaking about like sexual connection or intimacy and just being perverted or
horny but honestly I don't believe so at all. I really believe that stimulation
of the mind usually comes from that type of like lifestyle and I might write
another book about text, masturbation, marijuana, and alcohol all in proper
rations, proper moderation can ultimately allow a person to become you
know more self-aware and self-comfortable and I really feel like ultimately like
Jamie probably is more self-aware and more self-comfortable because of it. I don't
necessarily know how much but I do know that it did affect her a lot and I
really feel like in most relationships that that needs to happen sooner than
rather than later you know in some in our society you know in religious
situations most like people you do wait until they are like married well you're
supposed to marry before you actually like have sex but like you know you need
to like have those touching the same situation even if you're not actually going
to actually have coyotes you should at least have like situations where you're
massaging each other hugging touching sleeping cuddling kissing you know
just all types of stuff with each other to connect to make sure that it does
connection because to me and so like when you don't have that it becomes
difficult to to remember what the connections actually were you know what
is it all actually mean I mean for me I remember it because I've done it so much
it's like embedded in my mind so I can kind of deal with this thing long-term
but in reality most people probably wouldn't be able to achieve this much
that I have because of that and I really feel like people don't understand that
like you know masturbation is like a superpower and I think some women if not
all have achieved that because they probably secretly do naturally all the time
you know there's always these jokes about women having their toys in their bag
or in their house or in their bed or you know and they become more comfortable
with themselves because of it and they don't really and they don't and they
don't necessarily have time isn't able to kind of like keep up with that and I
really feel like what happens is that you know there needs to be some sort of
understanding about why that is so because we hide a lot of information
that's the problem there's a lot of hidden numbers and the hidden functions in our
society that we don't get a chance to talk about and people don't really express
how they are what they want with how they feel we don't talk about that at all
instead what we talk about is you know how much money we have or you know or we
got married or we didn't get married or you get in the world and we have a
child we don't talk about like why or how and because somehow we think that doing
that it helped people to like know what they're saying for example there's this
necessary need but people to keep saying say less say less you know now saying
less is probably good because there are certain circumstances like you know you
may not want to go ahead and go to your job and tell your job all the things you
gonna do in the future but you do want to go online and you want to address you
know you're looking for people who are interested in these things because you
need to have people around you who kind of like think or act like you do you know
it's not about just protecting your stuff because you know because like not saying
anything doesn't protect you anything that doesn't say my for example my my
father he's not really a big talk he hasn't had many friends he basically he
back he talks with but his ass still needs fucking help with it he runs into
a problem you know and that's what it that's what issues are so anyway that is
the that is the conversation I actually have about the central message you know
this you know the connection is really important and with me and Jamie we have
a very strong connection but connection that is like five by
far like you know I I mean like there is an issue that when you go ahead and
you have a relationship go ahead and the first thing that you want to do is you want to feel
comfortable around the person you want to be you want to be not really humble but
yeah a little bit humble humility but you want to be able to be yourself you
know and if you have to sit back and pretend with everybody it makes a big deal
about what's going on so that's what this whole book is about you know trying to
address these things the people who actually would be interested in listening
to that and and understand that like connection is important right now a lot
of people I really believe that it's gonna very figure this out that that's
gonna be the connection and then the people who actually going to be winning
it's gonna be the people who are connected that way because you I don't
think you can ask you can say anything to anybody without that connection
so that's basically it
