Expansions of questions, a conclusion chapter was the rest of this book.
What was the journey?
Throughout this book we've embarked on a journey that traversed the highs and lows of our relationship,
my relationship with Jamie, from our chance to encounter in the bustling cities, to intimate
parts of the train station and other parts of the town that really opened up our idea
on what we were.
Being with Jamie, it sometimes felt kind of wrong.
I mean, because the idea of us being together was like, it was random, but then it became
like it felt like it was too normal, you know, like it was too easy.
Most of the time when I, you know, most of our relationships, you know, I would meet the
girl who's at work or school and there's like a series of conversations and events that
might lead us to actually having a relationship.
But this point was just like by chance I ran into her and we were able to start talking
and before long, you know, she just had every single thing that was, it was like too perfect.
And the journey, you know, kind of took off where ups and downs were natural.
You know, there was some fighting, there was some, there was a lot of like intimate moments
like lovemaking and hissing and spontaneous, you know, intimacy, like in the car when we
were driving to Canada, you know, and so it was really hard to me to see that her body
wanted it, her body was really there and my body was really there.
And I enjoyed that connection and I really feel like when it comes down to what is real
and what is fake, I don't think, I think that fake is whatever you don't choose to believe
is fake and then real is whatever you choose to be, is real.
And our journey together was pretty real, we had a lot of problems that we had to overcome
and I was able to understand more about how to, you know, to fight them or to not really
fight them or to overcome them, you know, that's like some of the main points of it.
You know, I try to, you know, a lot of the experiences were traveling and just living
together, trusting each other, dealing with, you know, people who wanted us to be together
versus people who didn't want us to be together, you know, also, you know, it looked like, you
know, Jamie also had a lot of jealousy, you know, a lot of jealousy in here, I didn't make
a chapter for that, but there could be an entire chapter on how she was very jealous
or she was always looking for something to fight with, you know.
For example, there was one experience where she went into my phone and was able to find
exactly where, you know, a girl was texting me and I kind of like hit it on my phone
and she was able to find that immediately, you know, and I don't know what happened, I
think that it was locked or it was open one time or one time I went ahead and she found
me texting, like, had a comment for Chiharo and me and Chiharo had a conversation online
and I exported that content and put it in my computer and then she started complaining
about that and I didn't really understand what that was about, you know, it felt like,
you know, for me, I really feel like there's nobody at all at this point in our lives
that hasn't had relationships and had baggage, so for anybody to come in and try to break
all these things down, it's kind of like immature.
You know, emotionally, I was connected with her and was able to deal with her immaturity
because I expected it, that's what happens when most relationships, you start out relationship,
it starts out where it's like this curiosity and then there might be an opportunity where
things are positive and expect, it's great and then it leads to like fear that you won't
be able to have it for long and then jealousy, anger, you judge yourself, you judge each
other, you know, and you constantly are fighting with it, not only with the person but with yourself.
I kind of passed all of that in my life, I already had all of those levels, I already
went through all of those experiences and went through all of those, what we would call
like side quests in life, so looking at her, I was just like, I was able to, I had enough
patience to deal with it, so that's kind of like where I was in my realm with her.
Another key experience that I actually wanted to, you know, talk about with the journey was
when we finally went to Japan, you know, I think Jamie was, there were a few people
who went to Japan, you know, Matthew went with me, you know, then Mike and David, you know,
two of two friend of mine, one of them was from work, one was from, on our cable event, those
two of whom he did Japan and then, he was just Jamie, but Jamie was a girlfriend, so we were
very much more intimate with each other and she spent most of her time, you know, with
me, she went, she went specifically for me and she didn't really know anybody there,
and you know, whether it was a real situation or not, I just feel that I was really happy
to have her there because the actual trip was exciting because I was able to go ahead and
enjoy the, the, I was able to enjoy the, you know, Japan all over again because she didn't,
she wasn't able to go ahead, she wasn't able to go ahead and, and see Japan from Napa Secos
and I'm pointing that I was looking at it, you know, another thing about her was that she
spoke to Chinese, so most of the Chinese characters around was available, there was
even a moment when it was in Japan in a, in a city called Totori where there was another
girl who was Chinese, she spoke to Chinese from Hong Kong and I kind of missed out an
opportunity to like, maybe experience some time along both of them, but I didn't take
that, that opportunity because I was kind of like angry about something and I kind of took
a walk, you know, and then she went on, she went to the, to the diner, to the restaurant
where she met this girl and only when I came back to the hotel that she said, oh, she ran
to this person, you know, so these are the, some of the experiences that seem to be kind
of like, they were just made up and I didn't really like it, I, I mean, it felt, at one
point I felt like they were like real, but after a while I began to believe that the experiences
that we were having were not, was not real, you know, and the experience that we were
actually having was like, prefabricated, you know, people already knew what I wanted
and it was trying to take what I wanted and try to like, give back to me and that made
it very difficult, you know, it made it very difficult and, you know, I don't know, just
thinking about it right now, I get a little bit activated because, you know, like, when
I have my fantasies about what I actually want, I kind of wanted to be where it feels like
I'm actually creating it, you know, I don't want it to feel that somebody's actually,
you know, knowing that, oh, this is what I like and I'm going to come over here and
be this way and then this is going to allow him to want that, you know, and it's just
like, really, like, it's not, I'm not like a 17-year-old kid that is this exciting about,
I say it's the thing, I kind of want to have an argument about why we should do something,
why my fantasies are actually something I want to infiltrate and make them part of my reality.
But the journey, you know, you didn't ever run ahead and got a chance to do any of that.
But the relationship was actually pretty exciting.
Right now, at the time of this fight, you know, there's a lot of problems with the towns,
you know, like, the pandemic has led a lot of, you know, companies not, you know, hiring
as quickly as possible and, you know, me having to be pushed out of my apartment and lose all
my things and also with Jamie not letting me, like, you know, see her regularly because
of whatever the problem is, you know, has really led me to be angry at, like, not really
myself, but let it be upsetting with just, you know, just the world, you know, like, why
do we have to go ahead and deal with a situation where people have to, like, go through so much
fucking pain and suffering in order to actually obtain it?
Why can't we get to what we all understand that everybody goes through, like, suffering
and pain?
And hopefully, it will allow people to start developing patience and they'll just start
waiting for the things that they want.
For example, if you are looking to become, like, I always like to work in technology.
I always like working in programming and design and I was looking to get a job.
In these fields, not alone, I was over the consultant and never got to get a full-time job
working in, like, a software development company.
I always believed that with enough time and enough effort and enough, you know, talking
to people that I would be able to obtain some form of work and, quite honestly, I still believe
in it, you know, and I really feel like that's something we need to go ahead because it's
very hard to look at somebody and then look at what they're doing and what they, what
and their potential, just by them talking and sharing their resume.
We need, like, a daily, you know, connections of what they've done.
You need to be able to kind of, like, search and sort through all the things they do and
what they're capable of and then hopefully be able to get them to become more of an asset
to your business, not just because of how much they know of a particular, you know, educational
discipline, you know, but also their personal integrity and their will to learn and to change
and to adapt.
You know, that really comes from...
