All right, so this is the next trip, we asked another Airbnb, but this wasn't in East New
York.
It was kind of like still East New York, this is like, yeah, East New York, it still was
East New York, but it was the Valentine's Day.
And we would just, you know, because the house was still always full, we didn't have any
places where you have any privacy.
So the best place to go for piracy was Airbnb, we just stayed there for like, I think one
night, we bought some food, and then we used that in my show, and then we had sex, and then
we went to a room one.
And I don't know how it really could feel, but what did I want to know, like, how does that
make you feel?
Like, do you feel that our relationship was just filled with sex, and that's what it
was?
You feel like that was the only thing I made important, because I wasn't really trying
to make that important.
I don't want to make that the only thing, but I wanted to make it where that's what we do
for each other.
We do these things, these have true old things for each other, to make it feel better.
And they're like, it's just something about that, they're just, that's okay, people don't
understand that and ask what she's supposed to do, you know.
But they'd also like, you know, it doesn't really, it doesn't really pay attention to
it, and it's, you know, they don't really understand that, and then I just feel like,
you know, that's just the whole, yeah, that's just the whole thing about, you know, the
world, you know, and I was just thinking back with the whole trip, and, you know, how
I was, how we were living, how I was, you know, I think, well, just thinking about the
Valentine's Day, is that I didn't think you would do it a little bit arguing, you know,
I said something, you got mad, and, you know, that's how it is, it's humanity, we always
get upset, but that was the time when I wasn't working at all, I was like, every day I was
like, I'm going to try to get into the job, and what ended up happening was, I had some
money left over from Jeff Blue, so we were just like hanging onto that, and then I also had
unemployment coming in, and I was taken care of that, and then I went to Japan, like, like,
right after that, we were arguing, some sort of argument, you know, and it looked like you
were trying to argue at that time, for some reason, you know, I think because the stress
between your father being sick, and your mom, or someone need to go out there, and then for
me, I'm thinking I want to go down to Japan, that was the pull from that, and I think at
that point, I went ahead, and I went to Japan, and then you went to, you know, you went to
China, and I think I have some videos and pictures somewhere on, like, different videos
that we were hoping, you know, I was talking about how this all managed with me, how this
was bothering me with you, you know, and how I still cared about you and wanted us to still
be together and stuff like that, and, and I made some, I don't know what happened, I
could go find it, I still have it somewhere, you know, but, you know, a lot of the videos
and stuff like that were lost in the video thing, so I had to find them, but yeah, so,
so going forward with that, the, you know, looking back at that moment, you know, you
could see that, you know, it was something about us breaking up, and then, like, you
go into Japan, and I'm going to Japan, and I was, and I told you again, and then you go
into China, and you also go take care of your mother, and, like, take your father, and that
was supposed to be the end of it, but you came back, I think you came back before me, or right
just around the time I came back, but, and while, and, and, but I remember just going
into that Valentine's Day trip, and this is a great time to just really enjoy our time
together, so, and yeah, was it, so, I do feel like that, it was kind of a tough time,
you know, I don't know what it was, I think it was just a lot going on, and I don't know
what was going on with you personally, but, you know, yeah, you know, the air being being
really allowed us to have time to go out and do things, rather than being stuck in a
hotel room, we had like this house where we could like just pretend we own the house,
just remember what's for a couple of days, or a few of the hours, so.
