So this was the vacation, it wasn't really vacation, it wasn't really a small vacation
to Fort Meade in Maryland or Baltimore, it was in Virginia, it was in Virginia.
And we spent a lot of time, you know, hanging out with Anthony, you know, my friend who,
you know, I became president going to, I met him at school, he was actually making a Japanese
course, but I was actually there taking, he was actually starting to rush in, while he's
in the course, it was so weird.
And you know, him being in the course, he spent a lot of his time being, you know, I guess,
you know, pretty laid back about his lifestyle, but he didn't come off in his hospital and
anything like that.
I remember him talking about him riding his bike everywhere, that's what he was basically
doing.
And he went to the commissary to go to the store, he booked food and stuff like that.
And we also, you know, we also went to the store to buy some stuff for the road, but ultimately,
you know, we were going to Fort Meade, but I took him to the chest in Washington, DC,
so that was the whole reason why he went to Fort Meade.
You know, we could have a little bit of quarrel now, I really believe that, you know, during
that, during this particular time, you know, you were very, you were very big on quarrelling
with me about, I don't know, Z, either you thought that I was going to, you know, leave
you for Z, or I was secretly thinking of Z while I was with you, and you couldn't really
express yourself.
I thought I'm imagining that you were thinking that, because I wasn't trying to go back
to her, you know, I didn't really think that she was, you know, where it's already, you
know, the things we needed to do, the things we were doing together was the things that
I wanted from a relationship, and you were doing that, I wasn't getting anything from her.
But I also felt that, you know, you just, you just didn't go ahead and make it easy for
me to, you know, be myself.
And the fighting with you guys, I guess that you were trying to make sure that I couldn't
go back to her unless you knew, or, I don't know, but it was just really frustrating, so
I know for a fact that, you know, that if you did go and move to Fort Me, or we weren't
going to the ship, that you must have really been interesting, I don't know what it was,
but, you know, you wouldn't really tell me, but, you know, I think that, you know, I really
appreciated that you did go and trip like that, when I went out to, when we went on vacation
like that, that trip, for example, or Boston, you know, you took a lot of time to do it together,
you know, and there's just nothing better than you.
And being able to, you know, enjoy the time we had together in random places like that,
you know.
It was a weekend trip.
I think we spent, I think it was there for just a few days, you know, then we went out
there on, like, Saturday or Friday or Friday night, Saturday, you know, and you stayed there.
We sat there, we sat there tonight, and we watched that movie, three idiots for him.
So actually, just thinking of it now, is that, okay, since we've seen three idiots and two
thousand, and do something, I remember talking about three idiots with a JetBlue employee
back in the day, so, so that means, to me, that, that, you know, that, you know, that,
because I seen JetBlue, I saw the JetBlue employee, and I don't want three idiots, that
must have been that I saw the movie, and I was talking to him about it, so we, I had
to have been to, I had to have gone to, don't mean, first of all, to do that.
This means that it was December of 2017, it was December of 2016, that we went to, that
we went to, to the fourth meeting in Washington, we see it.
Because I think I was telling him, I think that I was telling him about, you know, the fact
that I was, you know, working this job, and he was like saying, well, you know what I mean,
I'm like, I got, I do, you know, you know, when you grew up with your parents being, you
know, be the science, you know, professionals and stuff like that, so, but they didn't want
their son to go to it, so, they kind of like drove me to do it, you know, and, I don't
know, so, anyway, and one thing about it is just that, you know, you always was there,
you know, I was always there, you kind of always spent, you know, time, you know, showing me,
you know, the, you know, you always was nice about it, you know, I knew, I always worried
that things wouldn't last, you know, so, I never really wanted to, I never really wanted
to, I never really wanted to go ahead and like hold on too much, too tight, so I always
thought that that would lead to being, you know, being disappointed with us breaking up
or something like that in the future, but, you know, we're still here today and, you know,
I really think just a lot, you know, and I have this thing going on, I want to go to, you know,
I want to go away in the kitchen now again, like, you know, like something like balled
dizzy or something like that, why, I don't know, I just think that, you know, that was
the type of trips we did and it brought in that type of trips kind of helped me feel more
about comfortable about myself with you, you know, so I do look forward for that.
Another thing about the move to show is that we kind of always had an opportunity to kind
of play around, like, you know, in the bedroom and stuff, but I have two or three pictures
of us there and I just really do enjoy that, you know, and I miss that type of flight, you
know, you know, and that type of time is being defended together, so I definitely would,
I definitely look forward to that in the future, you know, and, yeah, you know, yeah, I think
that's all it is for this particular trip from this particular time, you know, I didn't really,
I didn't really have too much to say about that, but I do remember also about, you know,
Z, you wasn't ever really a big fan of Z, and you, now is another time where you said
something in Z, either you, you got the texting, or you texted her, and you got the fighting
with a phone, and it was just a lot for me because, you know, I kind of like the fact
that, you know, you got to go like, you know, both fighting over it, but I didn't really
understand what was I, what was I so important that you had to buy a roommate, you got them
for fun to my girls, you know, any example I was, you know, I guess to you, you know,
I was just, you know, you know, I was just talking about the talk to you, you know, that
was it. Anyway, um, I was ended there.
