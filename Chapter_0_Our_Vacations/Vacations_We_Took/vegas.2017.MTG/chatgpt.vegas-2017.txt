The trip to Las Vegas was an exciting adventure that brought us closer together. It marked a special time where we could escape the regular routine and create lasting memories. I remember picking you up, the anticipation of seeing you again, and the joy that filled the air. 

As we ventured into the city that never sleeps, the energy was electrifying. The bright lights, bustling casinos, and vibrant streets created a unique atmosphere that was both thrilling and enchanting. We wandered through the famous Las Vegas Strip, taking in the iconic sights of extravagant hotels, dazzling shows, and world-renowned entertainment.

One of the standout moments was when we captured that picture of you inside the car. Your smile radiated happiness, and it was a snapshot of pure joy frozen in time. The image became a keepsake, reminding us of the happiness we shared during the trip.

We indulged in the city's renowned culinary scene, savoring delicious meals at various restaurants. From exquisite buffets to fine dining experiences, the food was as diverse as the city itself. And let's not forget the lively nightlife – the city truly comes alive after dark. We explored clubs, lounges, and bars, dancing and enjoying each other's company late into the night.

During our time in Las Vegas, we also had the chance to relax and unwind. Whether it was lounging by the pool or taking leisurely strolls, we found moments of tranquility amidst the city's vibrant chaos. And, of course, the magic of Las Vegas extended to our personal connection as well. Our bond grew stronger as we shared experiences, laughs, and deep conversations.

As the trip came to an end, there was a bittersweet feeling. The memories we had created would stay with us forever, but we also knew that we would soon have to return to our daily lives. Yet, the trip left us with a sense of renewed closeness, a reminder of the adventures we could share together.

Looking back, that Las Vegas trip became a cornerstone of our journey. It was a time when we set aside our differences, embraced the excitement of the city, and found solace in each other's company. And that picture of you in the car – a simple moment frozen in time – continues to bring a smile to my face whenever I think about it.


So, this conversation was pretty strange. It started with an argument, mainly about you using my phone. You had a habit of checking things on my laptop and then not mentioning it. It confused me why you kept doing that, as it's not your usual behavior. I didn't have anything to hide, and it didn't make sense to me.

It felt like you were searching for reasons to argue, hoping it would push me into doing something, which would benefit you somehow. I felt like you were getting these ideas from others, but I needed you to see that it wasn't true. You seemed upset about a simple thing, which didn't make sense.

The whole situation was confusing. Nobody seemed to understand what they were trying to achieve. I was finding it hard to argue about it because life isn't always clear. It's like we were going about our lives, doing our thing, but people were interpreting it differently, and I couldn't really defend against that.

For instance, when I met Yao, you seemed bothered. I always told Yao about you, but it seemed like you were getting into arguments with others. I didn't understand why, or why people were having those conversations. You seemed to be acting strangely, almost ridiculously, and I didn't know how to handle it.

I felt like I was trying to make the best of a unique situation. If I couldn't do that, there was no way to make things better. I wanted our relationship to be about more than arguments. Like after our Las Vegas trip, things felt good. We were enjoying each other's company.

I remember going to play magic in a tournament and trying to mix in work as well. There were some problems, like getting delayed at the airport and having to stay till the morning. It annoyed me how they handled it, and I didn't like the situation. I just wanted us to get along, but arguments and work issues made things challenging.

At the end of the day, the trip was positive. I was happy for the time we spent. There were times we went to different places, stayed at houses or Airbnb spots. There were some disagreements, but they didn't leave much impact. That was the last trip mentioned in the book.

The following trip to Japan was booked on my own, and it didn't work out as planned due to contract issues. Despite it all, I enjoyed our time in Vegas, especially the picture of you in the car, looking beautiful as always.
