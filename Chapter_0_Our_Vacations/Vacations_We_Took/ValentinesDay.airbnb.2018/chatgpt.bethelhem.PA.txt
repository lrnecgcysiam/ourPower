Alright, this is our second vacation. It was in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. We started visiting there a lot on weekends when I was working in Maplewood, New Jersey. You see, on weekends, I didn't have to work, so we'd head to Bethlehem. We'd spend a day there, enjoying food, walking around, and just exploring the area. This was back in the summer of 2016, and it was pretty cool to have you over on the weekends.

During those trips, we had some interesting experiences. One time, we had this soup that had a funny smell, almost like farts, and we couldn't stop laughing about it. We also ate at a Waffle House, which I really liked. The first apartment we stayed in Bethlehem was with some Indian folks on the second or third floor. We hung out there for a bit and then moved on to another place.

Looking back, those trips were pretty enjoyable. They were a nice way to spend weekends together, especially since the house was often crowded during the weekends. It felt good to have our own place for a while. Despite some challenges, those times created some good memories. I'm glad we had those opportunities to spend time together, as it strengthened our relationship.

However, during that period, there were also some concerns. I was dealing with getting a driver's license and sorting out insurance, which wasn't always easy. I remember how insurance was surprisingly expensive, and it seemed unreasonable. It could have been more affordable if my family had put me on their insurance, but that wasn't the case. It felt frustrating to deal with these issues.

Speaking of my family, there were other situations that added to the complexity. They wanted to control things, and I felt that they were trying to manipulate circumstances. This actually ties into a larger issue that I plan to write about someday. It's about how control and manipulation can impact people's lives and relationships.

But coming back to our vacations, the trips to Pennsylvania were a mixed bag. They were somewhat long journeys, but they were definitely enjoyable experiences overall.
