Okay vacation number two um what was vacation number two? Vacation number two was the pet
Beth um we started visiting Bethlehem a lot in Pennsylvania so each weekend used to work
in Maplewood, New Jersey and on the weekends you wouldn't have to work and it allows you to work
to hang it be with me during the weekend so we would actually would go to Bethlehem and stay
there for a day watch food eat watch food travel walk around and stuff like that you know find
from visiting the area and then on Sunday come back home and during that time that was early
in the religion like that was like 2016 summer of 2016 so you you know you would go home afterwards
and uh you know we we had we had a great time
um one of the things that I would say is a one of one of the things I would say is uh
is uh I guess one of the things I would say that is uh a like a memory during that time was
you know having to eat that soup that kind of smell kind of funny he said you should say it's
small like farts and then all eating at Waffle House you know which was also great I love eating
at Waffle House um you know I you know the the that was the first apartment that was in
Bethlehem where the Indian people were living out I was like on the second floor I see the second
or the third floor I don't know we were on that floor and we went there and then after that we went to
um what do you call it again and then and then we could be drove back home you know and it was
fine you know I I enjoyed it I thought it was fine I think that the one of the things about
these little vacations that we had it was that it helped with us having a place to stay during
the weekend during the weekend because everybody would usually would be home on a weekend and it
would be hot and sweaty if we didn't have anything else anybody else to go
so we decided to go ahead and and you know enjoy that time um uh I think that traveling
to Hershey Park was after one of the things we went to from there as well you know it was great I
mean uh you know life wasn't so bad but it was it wasn't it wasn't so good as well I mean like
there was a lot of things going on with the oh the whole idea of me being out there was trying to get
the driver's license and the getting the the insurance stuff like that because the whole time
the insurance and everything was very expensive and that's another thing that drives back to my
family is that you know now my mom has a car it's registered in her name and she's pretending that
she has to you know do something and she's hoping to hold on to something and I can see that
this is where the evil part of it is like she just wants to be in control and things that she
can do something so she even talks to my you know to pay me and there's no reason for her to talk to
or you or me but she has to like you know she has to be in some sort of some control you know
of some sort that going back but for example going back to you know the conversation
of being out there is that if I was with if she was using the insurance I could have
I could have had cheaper insurance because she would have had the insurance for me but she didn't
have insurance for me at all so I ended up having to pay a lot of money for insurance I don't know
why it was so expensive but like you know I never had an accent you know but for some reason
the insurance was always very expensive and um uh yeah you know I just never really wanted to
you know to deal with it you know I don't really don't really didn't care about that so you know
going back to our conversation you know like I really felt like that's what we wanted out
of our relationship that was really important to do because if we didn't have that what would
you but we'd have you know and and I think I was I finally was able to get cheaper insurance
um somewhere in 2017 it took like a took a couple of months before I was only able to get you know
cheaper insurance and um yeah so I'm basically you know happy about that but like now you know
it being like $90 she make it look like because if that the reason why it's $90 is because it's
on liability but like it could have I could have paid it down before they're just been problems
and I'm realizing that the problems are because somebody else is just angry and trying to control
the situation and I will be writing another book about my idea about the whole thing and why I
believe that it's actually like a problem because um there's no way that it should be like this
you know somebody time it like oh you were like using somebody else's identity
like that doesn't make any fucking sense at all like you can't possibly how do you argue that
you know if that if that's so powerful and I can and somebody can I can take advantage of
somebody's situation like that then the whole fucking situation is just flawed and everybody's
just living in their own fucking little line so that's kind of like where I look at it you know
so I won't really argue about that but yeah you know Pennsylvania trips were great
they were kind of long but you know it was great
