all right vacation number two oh no this is like no this is vacation well Virginia
Beach and Washington DC so this trip we kind of put together because we want to
go to Virginia Beach say you want to go to beach you want to go somewhere was
warm it wasn't exactly warm yet it was at the end of April beginning of May or
beginning of May and April and we booked the trip we drove down to Washington DC
hung out in Washington DC then we went to
which in your reach which was like a drive a half over from Washington DC I
think that this trip was a really nice one because we kind of did things that
was a little bit more you know like boyfriend girlfriend type of thing you know
we had a lysote trip and I was really was happy for it you know taking the
trip down there and I and one thing about it was that we were taking the trip
because I think that as soon as I got back there was a trip to Florida with
those people at my job which I didn't really you know care too much for but I
did it because I thought that's what they wanted me to do and the idea was
that you know there was some of us trying to like well I'm not thought about that
term nobody was Virginia Beach Jim so you know you drove a little bit I drove
a little bit we went to the caverns which was really nice those caverns
like seeing how the caverns like terrorizes out of like you know over long periods
of time and then you know also taking the pictures in Washington DC the
pictures that we took in Washington DC was nice they were very pretty nice
looking I enjoy those pictures one thing I didn't like about the pictures though
was the the the follow up the pictures and was that I feel like you wasn't
really like interested in a lot of the things was going maybe you didn't pay
attention to maybe didn't care or you didn't know too much about the history
about Washington DC and stuff I enjoyed going down there with you it was fine
and then we stayed we finally got the Virginia Beach I bought that vape which
is like really bad maybe that vape I bought where the I put it on too strong
and it was just so I guess it was just so high that it just entered into my
stream so much of it and I couldn't even drive and I had to address you to drive
and you drove and yeah it was just was was crazy you know you drove and I I I
I really ever like leave that much trust on anybody to drive especially my own
car and when you finally got back I really was happy you know about the
trip down there and and you know it was nice being able to be out there with you
and stuff like that and I really feel like that's more important you know when
it comes down to like you know relationships and stuff like that you
know being able to have like you know happiness like that you know so but
anyway yeah the the overall idea of of the trip was being able to the overall
idea of the trip was being able to to be aware of the surroundings in such a way
that you know we would you realize that we weren't in it wasn't in New York you
know anymore and I was happy for that one thing I didn't like about you know
that you know going out there was that it was kind of cold we got the
Virginia Beach it wasn't completely opened up out there so we didn't really
get a chance to do much of the sightseeing and we wanted to do what I was
planning on doing the jet the jet ski you know you wanted to drive it so fast
and like speeding around and stuff you know I didn't mind like you probably
really bad I think that I just knew what it was cold and I wasn't really
feeling about being I wasn't really feeling like being inside the thing over
there you going are you going go go on the fucking road that's sitting here and
trying to teach me something you know so it's just like really like
aggravating and I don't know how else it really you know put it and they don't
know what they're basically doing you know they just kind of like playing
attention to all their things and and putting together their their ideas but
overall you know it's is aggravating you know it's just aggravating because I
distilling really pay your attention to so so yeah so
so what I'm gonna say oh the the overall you know idea of the trip was
great you know I just I don't know I think we need trips like that and now but it
felt like there was like this eager to like you know not like mess with you but
try to like like like it was like an eagerness to kind of like make your your
life like frustrating more you know and I don't know how else it really did go
about you know saying and you know and I was really excited about you know
but you know yeah this trip really wasn't that I don't really don't have too much
about saying about this trip except for the fact that you know this is a great trip
